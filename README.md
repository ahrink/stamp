Note: An enumeration is a complete, ordered listing of all the items in a collection
– regards a listing of all of the elements of a set


Enumeration vs Permutation
“as long as not zero, we have a problem”
[a little algebraic where a != b means calculus]
contextual(a,b) aka enumeration or permutation
contextual(a,b) where a is a priory followed by b;
-this amalgam a,b [as an array] is a quest where b could become a in its own loop.

- In programming we use loops to enumerate or for permutation reasons. Applicable in practice and known as priorities(a=priory).

Assigned words in (a)contextual is enumeration
Assigned words in (b)contextual is permutation but also possible to be enumeration;

amalgam? is a mixture or blend of above mentioned two words and by by God's will, I as saint, [aka San Anton] shall be allowed to baptize as:

- dissecting this amalgam to result in a main menu [with options] where:
1. Enumeration is the main menu
2. Permutation is a loop ending in a main menu item

Some consideration:
a=”An enumeration is a complete, ordered listing of all the items in a collection”
use: in regards to a listing of all of the elements of a set
Note: San Anton may baptize enumerations.

b="In mathematics, a permutation of a set is, loosely speaking, an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order";
San Anton said we have no limitation in b, while b is constrained to a substantive(a).

More on permutation as a definition:
an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order
-example: {\displaystyle \alpha (1)=3,\quad \alpha (2)=1,\quad \alpha (3)=2}.

A point of start in a loop: [1677, Fabian Stedman]
Starting from two bells: "first, two must be admitted to be varied in two ways"

And compare a progression with regression:
In statistical modeling, regression analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships between a dependent variable (often called the 'outcome' or 'response' variable, or a 'label' in machine learning parlance) 

First, regression analysis is widely used for prediction and forecasting, 
while, Geometric progression, sequence of numbers such that the quotient of any two successive members of the sequence is a constant ... AHR: established here as a priority where regration may become a Geometric progression to solve a possible prediction!

AHR: [contextual approach in math as a formula]
In science, a formula is a concise way of expressing information; - symbolically, as in a mathematical formula or a chemical formula. 

Formula? [method of exhaustion] aka "reductio ad absurdum" or an alias of reductio ad absurdum where methodus exhaustionibus is Greek. 

Further consideration is a conclusion:
- per above mentioned concluding that (a) is a main menu and it known in programming as do while [coming back to this subject matter] and incorporates (b) as substantive. Why we are here on this subject matter or a methodus exhaustionibus!

San Anton 20230724 “a spark of truth cannot be lost” AHR said that!
EnomPerm  0 or 1;
